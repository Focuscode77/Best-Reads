# Best-Reads

Best-Read is an application designed to make a new and updated Goods Reads app. We looked over the old model and decided to update and create a new client side visual geared towards our generation. We wamt to make a easy experience to track your books without thinking about it.

## About the App
BestReads is a Full Stack web application that allows the user to keep track of books that they are currently reading, books they have read in the past and books they hope to read in the future. 
The application utilizes the following technologies:
- The MySQL database stores the user's information, their Current, Past and Future Reads lists and the book information which is populated by the GoodReads API.
- The app runs on a Node Express server
- Express-Handlebars is used as our serverside templating engine
- Node Sass is used as our CSS processor
- Password.js with Google and Amazon sign in for user authentication

## Process
We are huge fans of the website Goodreads, a sort of social media app for books. However, the dated and cluttered design of the original site detracts from its functionality and potential consumers are deterred by its confusing UI. We decided to create a redesign of the website. We used modern day leading social media websites, such as Instagram, as inspiration for our minimalist and sleek look. We decided to narrow down our MVP to a list-making app, with roomm for expanding it to encompass and improve on the other features that make Goodreads remarkable, such as: a feed of user interactions, recommendations, lists and community.

## Overview
In order to use BestReads, you will need to sign in with a Google or Amazon Account.
Once you have logged in, you can search for books using the search in the navbar. Books can be added to any of the three default lists (Current, Past, Future) by clicking the blue plus sign. These books can then be viewed in the "My Lists" page. 
In addition, you can view your profile page, which is populated with information taken from your Google or Amazon account.

## Coming Soon
We have many big plans for BestReads. In the short term we plan on adding functionality to make our lists more user friendly. Users will be able to delete and move books that they have added to their lists and create custom lists. They will also be able to edit their profile page.
